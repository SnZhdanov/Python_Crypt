# Python_Crypt
Basic caeser cipher implementation and a simple heuristic to "crack" the cipher.
Test Simple runs a statistic analysis on how well the cracking algorithm works using a large txt file.
Innocents.txt is the text file I used for the testsimple(a,b) function, but any txt file can be used for it.
